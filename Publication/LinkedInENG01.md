# Modern Approaches to Data Analysis in the Pharmaceutical Industry – How Python, AI, and Agile Project Management Methods Reduce Compliance Costs

Contemporary pharmaceutical operations cannot function without robust statistical data analysis – it is essential for monitoring process quality, assessing product stability, and making decisions in line with GMP requirements. Traditional statistical tools often come with high implementation and maintenance costs, and their flexibility leaves much to be desired.

## Why Python?

An increasing number of companies recognize that using open-source technologies such as **Python**, as well as artificial intelligence and agile project management methods, can significantly reduce the cost of analysis and accelerate the adoption of innovative solutions. This approach enables you to:

- **Automate data analysis** – limiting manual calculations and minimizing errors,  
- **Use flexible and intuitive interfaces** – web-based tools built on Python can be adapted to the needs of the pharmaceutical industry,  
- **Break free from expensive licenses** – Python is open-source, helping reduce expenses,  
- **Work in a browser or locally** – many solutions can run online or on your own computer.

## Example Capabilities of Statistical Analysis in Python

1. **Trend Analysis and Process Stability**  
   Allows for tracking and predicting changes in key quality parameters.

2. **Control Charts (e.g., ImR) and Process Capability Indices (Cp, Cpk)**  
   Helps evaluate whether a production process meets quality requirements.

3. **Stability Data Assessment**  
   Analyzes the long-term stability of a product depending on storage conditions.

4. **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**  
   Determines whether differences between data groups are statistically significant.

5. **Comparing Active Substance Release Profiles**  
   Verifies whether products have similar release profiles under different conditions.

## Pharmstat2 – An Example of Using Python

To illustrate how open-source solutions work in practice, we recommend taking a look at a sample application showcasing a small fraction of Python’s statistical capabilities: **[Pharmstat2 – online tool](https://pharmstat2.streamlit.app/)**. With this tool, you can, among other things:

- **Quickly analyze process trends and stability**,  
- **Create control charts** (e.g., ImR) and **calculate Cp and Cpk**,  
- **Assess product stability data** under various conditions,  
- **Perform analysis of variance (ANOVA)**,  
- **Compare active substance release profiles**.

This application can run directly in a web browser, which means there is no need to install additional software.

## How to Prepare the Data?

To use the application, simply prepare an Excel file in accordance with the guidelines available in the tool. Each module includes instructions on the data format, enabling you to quickly upload your file and obtain ready-to-use analyses.

- **For most modules**, you only need to provide data as a single column of values, with the first row specifying the name of the variable being analyzed (e.g., the active substance content).  
- **For stability, temperature and humidity modules, and active substance release profiles**, the data should be arranged in two or more columns (for instance, test duration and test result).

Two sample worksheets are attached to this article:

1. The first – for testing modules for descriptive statistics, histograms, control charts, PQR,  
2. The second – for testing the stability module.
